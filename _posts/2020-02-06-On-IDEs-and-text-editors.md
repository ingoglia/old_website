f you didn't know already, technical types tend to be rather particular about what appears somewhat ridiculous to the common man. One war is waged over what the best IDE is.

Through the course of my development in the technical fields, I too have spend hour upon hour, researching what IDE might be the best, trying at least 10 different options in depth. Meticulously configuring and then reconfiguring all the different IDE's to 'streamline' my work flow, and avoid the problems that I was currently facing in other areas of my life. It seems to me as though this is a right of passage for the computer nerd... so although I might give you some sage advice in the matter, you will probably consider me a sellout, and continue on the well trodden path. So, configure away I say.

I unfortunately, have the genetics of a purist, which means, I have to basically learn everything the hardest way possible. That being said, the first text editor that I chose was EMACS. I was a true believer that EMACS was the way when I first started using Linux. I would read the forums about how great Emacs was, look at stickers to put on my 20lbs laptop, so as to make sure everyone knew what side of the war I was on.

Those were good times, but eventually, as a spent more time on systems... less and less of them my own... the love began to fade. The reality is, most Linux systems don't have Emacs installed automatically... and not only that... but even if it were installed... it was never to my specifications. So I would spend all of this time setting up and working in a sophisticated environment, with no ability to transfer that to a different system.

I could see how this might work for a programmer type, that would spend most of their time on a single system... but I've always been more interested in the systems themselves, over the using of those systems to achieve certain goals.

I began my search for a new tool. In this process I had an affair with Eclipse which lasted for about a month... but again the issue of high complexity and a learning curve to just use the tool to get the work done.

So, I decided to go to the dark side. Despite my allegiances to EMACS, I gave in to Vim. Vim was so beautiful, and I realized how much better it fit my work flow. I was able to jump onto any system and automatically utilize all my Vim skills. I even bought some books on it and started to read up on how to become more proficient. There were tutorials on how to make vim into a fully usable IDE, which I kept up for a time.

However now, as I write this post, I realize that a new era has come for me. I now require a more robust tool for coding. Why? Well, vim is beautiful in its simplicity, and is wonderful for basic work. However to configure it to work as an IDE is quite time consuming. As I develop as a professional, I find that I have less time to focus on my editor and the fancy tricks I can do with it... and need it to just do it's job efficiently. So I have decided to try out a new option that was recommended to me. Visual Studio Code, not to be confused with Visual Studio (which is proprietary, or as I would say proprietary bull shit, when I was in my more ornery stage of life). The idea I like about Visual Studio Code is that it will allow you to use vi commands within the program (and did I mention it's open source).

To all of you purists out there who feel the need to torture thine self. Consider this... instead of spending your time configuring your ide, why not take all of that extra time and work through a book on algorithms. I guarantee you that you will feel the same levels of knowledge increase and anxiety, only you will be learning an actually meaningful skill.

Don't remake the mistakes of your elders~
