Reading Epistemology: By Richard Feldman

Through all of my reading on logic and the Greeks, I am realizing that many of my questions are related to epistemology. 

I have many philosophical questions that are unanswered... perhaps I should make some of them goals to understand instead of just walking boldly into the ether. I am sure many of my questions have answers or they are not answerable and there are proofs for such a case. 
 
*Are hallucinations always seen as outlier case? Why is this? All humans are capable of hallucination. It only take 3 sleepless nights to begin a decent into madness. 

*Is there anything that we can say we really know? Most people around me assume so much about reality. So much that I cannot see as obvious. 

*What is the ontology of a thought? Most people that I have met seem to believe that an idea is less real than a chair. Why is this? Does a thought /'exist/'?

*Infinity is something that we can think about, but does it exist? If so, is there any way for us to access a knowledge of it?

*What is truth? Is there absolute truth? 

*Is objectivity real? Is subjectivity real? What is the meaning of my own perceptions of myself and others?
