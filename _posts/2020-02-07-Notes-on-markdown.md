While creating this site, I learned that the way these posts are formatted is by using markdown. Markdown is a very simple formatting syntax... but if you dont know it then you cannot put apostrophes in your posts. That is the reason why I know now that I must learn markdown. So I went to Lynda.com(now known as IN learning because massive Linkdin.com consumed it) and found a nice little mini course to learn         markdown. I find these MOOCs (Massive online open courses) to be so great for learning about technology. The course name is Learning Markdown.

Here are my notes:
* Two Returns will create a new paragraph
* You can\'t create more space with more returns
* Underscore(or asterisk) word underscore will create bold **word**
* \`code\` renders as `code`
* \\ is used to escape the special characters
*  \* can be used for a bullet list
   *  indenting the list will create lists of lists
* Tabs at the beginning of the line create code blocks
* space, space, tab is going to be a line break
* \=\=\= under your words for a level headline  
    ===
* \# will make a headline level one, add more # for smaller headline
##Sparkle
* Use \> for block quotes
 >hi there
 >>2 \> for a recursive block

*creating line spacing with \-\-\-

* Inline: link and clickable link appear together: use square brackets to create a link  
   \\[Hihi\]\\\(https://www.nobodylook.com\\)
   [Hihi](https://www.nobodylook.com)
