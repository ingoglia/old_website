I have noticed that people frequently have a what I would call a 'label first mentality'. By this I mean, people often select labels which they identify with, instead of using labels to identify aspects of themselves. Some popular examples being:

*I am a rock climber
*I am a liberal
*I am a innovative
*I am OCD

I would consider these to be well defined concepts in US society. We often use these labels to convey ourselves to others. However, I would argue that there is also a social definition for these concepts. When someone says that they are a rock climber, this conveys more than the simple fact that this is a person who enjoys digging their fingers into stones. It also conveys a lifestyle. 

The 'rock climber' is someone who will also likely identify with an entire set of other labels:
*I am health focused
*My body is super hot
*I am up with the trends 
*I am normative, I like what other upper middle class individuals like
*I am in the upper middle class
*I am not high strung, and I focus on my livelihood
*I will dress in mountaineering style clothes
*I like documentaries about people doing extraordinary things and overcoming challenges
*I am outdoorsy and independent

These secondary labels are frequently ascribed to the individual subconsciously by the listener. Our society is one where, it is frowned upon to talk highly of your qualities or skills. I believe this ascribing of secondary traits is used to circumvent the process of 'playing yourself up'. There is no need to tell someone that you are in good shape, you can simply identify with the label 'rock climber'. 

The reason why I call this 'label first mentality' is because, people, mistakenly in my opinion, assume that the labels are what retain meaning, and they aspire to achieve that label. In order to be the best rock climber, I must not only be able to scale the cliffs, but I must also 'look the part'. If I claim to be a rock climber, but I am out of shape, or wearing a polo shirt, I am not going to be as convincing to my listener. 

I find this unfortunate, because now, those who rebel against these labels often detest labels all together. 

I would like instead to take the 'meaning first mentality'. Instead of identifying ourselves with labels and aspiring to some socially constructed platonic form, perhaps we can use labels to convey general ideas about who we are to others. Conforming to labels stifles creativity and ascribes qualities to people that perhaps do not deserve or even desire them. 

I know it's a very subtle point, however I think it is a very destructive aspect of our language. I feel that people utilize these secondary meanings to manipulate other peoples perceptions of them and to be perceived as possessing merits that they have not earned. 

The 'ok' rock climber is given the same social status as the 'amazing' rock climber, simply because the 'ok' climber is dressed the same way and 'appears' to have the same qualities. It is almost as though the skill of rock climbing has become secondary to the secondary labels! 

This is, I believe, a desecration of labels. Labels can be magnificent tools for self development. By identifying with known concepts, we can more easily find more information pertaining to that concept. For example, if I identify with an illness, such as depression, then it is easier for me to find more tools to help in my recovery. 

Unfortunately, from a social interpretation, the label of depression might illicit in the listener a set of secondary labels that are damaging the the speakers social status. 

This results in a paradox. The speaker may refuse to identify with the label simply because they do not want the stigma of the secondary labels. However, if they did choose to identify with the primary label, they might gain insight and develop. Unfortunately, the secondary labels create barriers to the primary labels usefulness. 

Could we separate the social meaning of a label from the literal meaning? I think this would make language a whole lot more useful.
