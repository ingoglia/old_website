I just finished reading "Metaphysics, A Very Short Introduction", by Stephen Mumford. I find these books are a good way to quickly determine how you think relative to thevery basic academic identifications:

==Nominalist or Realist==

A nominalist, very basically, is someone who believes that abstract object are not ‘real’. The color red, or the perfect sphere… these are just constructs of our language, or of our minds.

A realist is someone that believes there is some kind of existence that can be ascribed to abstract objects. That there is some ‘realness’ to concepts like perfect circles or colors.

I identify more as a realist. Although I do not necessarily believe that all abstract objects are real in the same sense as the objects that we interact with on a daily basis, I do think that they have an existence of some kind.

==Reductionist or Emergentist==

A reductionist believes that everything that exists can be reduced to its parts. That we can describe the actions of all entities be listing their basic building blocks.

An emergentist is someone who believes that a whole is more than the sum of its parts. That conciousness for instance cannot be found entirely in our brain and bones, or that social dynamics are not the result of each individual that makes the group, but instead that the group think is an emergent property of the group. 

I identify as an emergentist. I believe that there is too much complexity in the world. An example would be economics, where thinking in terms of smaller housholds to define larger economic systems leads to low success rates.

==Endurantism vs Perdurantism== 

Endurantism is the idea that objects retain their identity through change. That even though I had a small body when I was a child, I am still the same person now that I was then.

Perdurantism implies that we do not have an enduring self, that as we, or any other object changes its properties, that it is no longer the same thing as it once was.

I identify as a perdurantist. I find it difficult to believe that something that has changed is the same as the thing it once was. There might be some kind of relationship between my child self and my adult self, but I find it difficult to believe that it is the same entity.

==Humean vs Non-Humean==

Humean’s believe that we cannot assume that cause and effect are related. 

Non-humeans believe that a cause and effect are related

I am a Humean. I don’t necessarily believe that cause and effect are not related, I just believe that since there is no way to prove this relationship, that we cannot assume it to be true, despite the prevailing evidence.

==Eternalism vs Presentism== 

Eternalism is the belief that past, present and future are all co-occuring and everything that has passed and has yet to pass exists at all times.

Presentism is the idea that everything is existing in the present moment. There is not past or future that exists.

I identify with eternalism.

This book was interesting and easy to approach with no previous knowledge about philosophy or metaphysics. I am glad I read it. I think it is a good practice to search for labels for ways of thought. Not to limit yourself, but to better find the responses to those beliefs, to test your own rationality. I say that I believe these ideas now, however I am uncertain that I will believe them tomorrow.
