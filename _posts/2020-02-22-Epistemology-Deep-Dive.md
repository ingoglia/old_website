What do I want to understand about epistemology? I think my interests must be related to metaphysics and Buddhism. 

I have never focused on the general study of epistemology, aside from the Buddhist focused texts I have read, so I am not really sure which labels I would identify with relative to the western tradition. My hope is that I will clarify a bit of this through reading this introductory book. What questions arise as I think about reading this book? What hope do I have in gaining this knowledge?

*I am curious to find labels for the ways I think.

*I would like those labels to help me identify my weaknesses.
