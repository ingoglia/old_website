My current project in philosophy is to gain a basic understanding of metaphysics. I have been working on this project for over a year now. This is part of a larger project of understanding mathematical logic, which I have been working on off and on for nearly 15 years. A substantial part of my mathematics degree was dedicated to studying set theory and the foundations of mathematics. I am not career or socially focused, and so I studied for the sake of understanding and learning.

 I had always been interested in philosophy, driven to understanding deep concepts as a child. I fell in love with mathematical logic in my early 20’s, when I was exposed to Godel’s Incompleteness Theorems. I felt that I didn’t understand them, but their implications struck me so deeply that I wanted to. Little did I know that this desire for understanding would result in several years of grueling college mathematics courses, only to find that even PHD level students were confused about the proofs I was seeking to understand. I didn’t care though… because I was determined.

Having completed my mathematics degree, I can attest to having walked through the incompleteness theorems (with the help of a patient and inspiring professor), and obtained a basic understanding of their implications. However, there is still so much work to be done to improve my understanding. While many mathematically minded people are content to understand the mechanics of a proof and be done with it… that was never enough for me. Perhaps that’s the reason why I have such a low probability of becoming a PHD mathematics student. I realized that, even though I was able to work proofs and see ‘why’ they were correct, I didn’t really understand what the proof ‘implied’. From my observation, it seems that in the academic world, seeking for the ‘meaning’ of proof in mathematics is a taboo. I imagine this stems from the ‘publish or perish’ mentality, paired with a philosophical predisposition to assume that mathematics is nothing more than a ‘symbolic game’, or only created for the sake of ‘real world’ applications. So I have taken the technical skills that I learned through my formal degree, and I am excited now that I am no longer a student, to study mathematics and philosophy on my own terms.
