I usually reconfigure my workspace every couple of months because I am not coding on a consistent basis. I never seem to remember how to do all of the cool tricks I taught myself and have to look everything up again. So I guess it might be a good idea to document what I have been doing to set up visual studio code in the way that I like so that I don't have to redo all of that work again.

In Visual Studio Code:
*Added plugins(don/'t forget to restart VSC): 
    *Auto Close Tag
    *Code Spell Checker
    *Vim
    *Terminal
*Changed the theme to /'Solarized Dark/'
*Used ctrl-+ to increase the size of the font

In Debian:
*Set up workspaces
    *added package gnome-tweak-tools
    *Relearned switching between workspaces by pressing ctrl-alt-up(down)
    *Enter and exit full screen mode for VSC F11
